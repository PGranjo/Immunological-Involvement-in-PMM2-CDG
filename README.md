# Project Aim

This study aimed to understand the molecular reaction of PMM2-CDG when exposed to inflammatory triggers, which will help in understanding the immune-related issues in these patients. PMM2-CDG is the most common among a group of rare metabolic disorders causing issues in the glycosylation process—a widespread function in the human body. We exposed skin fibroblasts from healthy individuals and patients to TNF-α and then analyzed their transcriptome using RNA-Seq. We confirmed the results by checking protein levels related to the identified pathways using immunodetection assays.
